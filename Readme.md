# Lol Spectator Overlay

This is a tool that produces a custom League of Legends Champion Select Overlay that is inspired by the one used in the LEC and LCS between 2015-2017.

## Usage

Just download the latest release for your platform and you are nearly ready to go.  
After downloading you have to press the button `Update Champion Images`.  
After that you just have to join a custom Lobby and press the button `Start Overlay`.  
If you want to fetch the summoner names of the players in the Lobby just press the button `Fetch Summoner Names`.
